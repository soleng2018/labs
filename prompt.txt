# In the roam2 folder create three files
1. parameters.txt
2. roam.sh
3. speedtest.sh

# In parameters.txt add
1. SSID_Name="My WiFi Network" This should take a SSID Name in quotes e.g. "My WiFi Network". The quotes are needed as there are spaces in the SSID name. 
2. Min_Time_Roam = A value in minutes e.g 5
3. Max_Time_Roam = A value in minutes e.g 10 # So the script will randomly choose a value between Min_Time_Roam and Max_Time_Roam and then wait for that time in minutes before roaming
4. Min_Signal = -75 # Min signal needed to roam between Access Points
5. Preferred_Band = "5G" # Can be 2.4G or 5G or 6G
5. Min_Time_Speedtest = A value in minutes e.g 5
6. Max_Time_Speedtest = A value in minutes e.g 10 # So the script will randomly choose a value between Min_Time_Speedtest and Max_Time_Speedtest and then wait for that time in minutes before running a speedtest

# roam.sh
1. Ensure the parameters.txt file has the necessary romaning parameters. Validate the values i.e. integer vs string
2. Automatically detect a wireless interface. Ensure its not wired or loopback. It has to be a wireless interface
3. If there are more than one interface select any one. IF there are no wifi interfaces found, exit from the script
4. Use wpa_cli to scan for the SSID_Name defined in parameters.txt on all bands 2.4 Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz
5. Automatically detect the BSSIDs for the SSID_Name. Filter out the ones that do not meet the Min_Signal value
6. Roam between between the BSSID based on a randomly selected value between Min_Time_Roam and Max_Time_Roam. Choose the BSSID to roam based on signal strength if there are multiple BSSIDs
7. There is only one BSSID, do not roam.
8. Use dhcpcd5 to get an IP address on first connection. Do not try and renew the IP address after a roam. Only renew if needed
9. Create a log file called roam_debug.log under /var/log/ directory. Log every detail possible. If the file exists append to it.
